# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and proxy target creation for credit risk modeling. 

- **eda.ipynb**: Initial exploration of the credit risk dataset, including summary statistics, missing values, outlier detection, and correlation analysis.  
- **feature_engineering.ipynb**: Creation of transaction- and customer-level features, datetime extraction, aggregation, and preprocessing for model readiness.  
- **proxy_target.ipynb**: Calculation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics, K-Means clustering of customers, assignment of high-risk proxy target variable, and merging into the processed dataset.
